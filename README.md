# Vite (the) UNDEAD edition

## Introduction

You know what!? I love Vite. I was a big fan of TSDX and CRA (create-react-app)
but Vite performance and simplicity got me addicted. Give me more Vite please.

Now I'm taking two steps further and creating my own personal Vite edition.
This one has all the right configurations and tools I am using day to day to
build deadly killing websites.

- React. I just like it.
- TypeScript. Deploying code w/o type-checking scares da bejesus outta me.
- TailwindCSS. Whatever float your boat man.
- ESlint+Prettier. Oh my lord, "space vs tab" arguments never more!
